## Description
  
This repository is a clone of a successfully funded and fulfilled Kickstarter project that was later abandoned.

For more details, refer to the original Kickstarter page: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/658903329/remoteboot-wifi-remote-management-module-for-pcs/comments

Included in this repository are the Gerber files to create your own board and a dump of the latest 1.0 firmware for the ESP8266 Module. This contains everything needed to set up the project. Please note that the original project had some unresolved bugs and issues. Since this is a direct dump of the original firmware, those bugs are still present.
